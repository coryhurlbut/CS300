What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  -This course requested students to create a program using C++ to sort courses and display them according to the user's needs. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  -I accomplished this by using a Binary Search Tree data structure as we learned through the course that it was consistently quick with sorting as well as   searching. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  -I overcame roadblocks by being resourceful and getting help via google and stack overflow when I could not figure something out myself in a reasonable amount of time. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  -This course has helped me realize the importance of optimizing data structures and algorithms for performance and usability.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  -I can now recognize possible issues much more easily. I used to have little to no idea of the cost of certain operations and Big O notaion but now I have some relative comfort on the topic.
